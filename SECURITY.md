# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We can only support the latest version of our project with security updates. We will not provide any support for issues on outdated versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, [open a draft security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory#creating-a-security-advisory).

After the draft security advisory is open, you can privately discuss it with collaborators and create a temporary private fork where you can collaborate on a fix. If you've already fixed the vulnerability, just fill out the draft security advisory and then publish it.
